# [2025-06-09] [Time spent: 6 Hours] Day 1: Brainstorming, and first steps
I'm trying to imagine how this thing would work, I was thinking of belt drives at first, but then i felt that it wouldn't be very accurate.

For now I'm making a list of the components I'll be using.

So I found a similar project online that I'll be taking inspiration from for this project, and it utilizes the following components

The list:
- Arduino Nano for control
- 3x Stepper motors (Model: 28BYJ-48)
- 3x Stepper motor drivers (Model: ULN2003)
- 3D printed frame

These are the main components at least, I didn't think of the other small components I'll need, like capacitors and stuff

Started designing the PCB, and making a BOM as I go.

Finished PCB design, FINALLY. The pcb took HOURS to finish, made me wish I had gone with the breadboard method instead. Hoping it works when I actually order it üò≠üôèüèª
